# event_photo_share

Event Photo Share is a personal project I've been working on that uses Ionic 2, Angular 2, and has a Firebase 3 backend.

So far it is a simple CRUD app with Firebase Authentication.

I have deployed it as a web app and iOS app so far.

See it live:
- Web: http://event-photo-share.firebaseapp.com 
- iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/event-photo-share/id1191691087?mt=8

Future plans include:
- Photo uploads backed by Firebase Storage
- Deep links
- Social link sharing
