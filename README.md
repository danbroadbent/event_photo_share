# event_photo_share

Event Photo Share is a personal project I've been working on that uses Ionic 2, Angular 2, and has a Firebase 3 backend.

Users can 
- Sign up/log in with Firebase Authentication
- Create an event
- Upload multiple photos at once to Firebase Storage

I have deployed it as a web app and iOS app so far.  (Check the web version for the latest build, iOS has a much longer update cycle and may be behind the web build)

See it live:
- Web: http://event-photo-share.firebaseapp.com 
- iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/event-photo-share/id1191691087?mt=8

Future plans include:
- Deep links
- Social link sharing
- Authorization based on user type
- Full progressive web app compliance
- Use local storage to speed up performance
